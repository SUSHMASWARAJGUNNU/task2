                <h2>MULTIAGENT-BASED ARCHITECTURE FOR THE DYNAMIC DSS</h2>
                <p>According to what has been described in the previous sections, we may distinguish
                    various activities that must be carried out during the dynamic DSS operation. This system
                    should work in the following way.<br>
                    When an enterprise domain requires some information, a user of that domain gets
                    into the dynamic DSS and formulates a query in natural language. The system interprets
                    that query, compares the contents of the query with its knowledge about the type of
                    information each domain can provide, and identifies the domains to which the information requirement must be derived. Then, the system communicates with this domain and
                    waits for an answer. In case it does not obtain a positive answer, it communicates with
                    the other domains. Once the pursued answer is obtained, this is transferred to the domain
                    of origin and, if necessary, the knowledge updating is also done.</p><br><br></div>

        <section class="container3">
            <div class="data"><br>
                <p>A system that operates in the described way can be implemented using the mobile
                agent technology (Rus, Gray, & Kots, 1998).<br>
                An agent is a software component that performs specific tasks in an autonomous,
                intelligent, and collaborative way in order to achieve its design objectives. Two classes
                of agents may be identified: static agents, which stay in their respective computers; and
                mobile agents, which are able to migrate among different locations of the network in order
                to perform their tasks locally.<br>
                A multiagent system consists of a set of software agents, each performing a specific
                activity but behaving as an organization, i.e., in a coordinated way. The main activities
                this system must perform are:<br>
                    • transferring queries to different domains of the system;<br>
                    • communicating with domains (either for capturing the query or answer or for delivering the answer or information requirement); and<br>
                    • identifying the domains able to provide an answer.<br>

                Each of these activities requires a different type of software agent. A multiagent
                architecture for this dynamic DSS should be made up of three main kinds of software
                agents:<br><br>
                a) Collecting Agents: mobile agents that visit the different domains to find out which of them can give the appropriate answer.<br>
                b) Domain Representative Agents: static agents that act as mediators between a domain and the mobile agents. They send the queries coming from users of the domain to the collecting agents and also transmit the answers to queries of the mobile agents that arrive asking for information.<br>
                c) Router Agent: an intelligent agent, which, interpreting the query, decides where the
                collecting agents should look for the answer. It is an agent that centralizes the
                knowledge about the system and whose main responsibility is the system efficiency. It owns the system knowledge base that stores each domain taxonomy and
                the associated weight factors. The router agent calculates the value of the
                discriminating function for each domain whenever an information requirement is
                presented to the system. It is also responsible for updating that knowledge base.
                In other words, the router agent performs the learning process, and thus it is
                responsible for managing the cases base.<br>

                Figure 1 is a schematic representation of the multiagent architecture for the dynamic
                DSS.<br>

                This multiagent system, as depicted in Figure 1, works as follows:<br>
                When a decision-maker needs specific information, the former, being helped by an
                assistant, expresses the information he/she would like to receive (1). Then, the assistant
                passes it to the Domain Representative Agent (2), which changes the query into a format
                accepted by the mobile agents and sends it to the Collecting Agent Server (3). The
                Collecting Agent Server gives the query to a domain Collecting Agent, and it goes to a
                special agent server—the Router Agent (4). It receives the Collecting Agent that has just
                left its domain, reads the formulated query, filters it, and according to the information kept
                in its knowledge base (5), it computes the discriminating function of each domain and
                gives the Collecting Agent a ranked list of domains that would provide the searched</p><br><br></div>

                <img src="img3.jpeg" >
                <p>information (6). The Collecting Agent visits these domains with its query (7). Once it has
                    found the answer and is about to go back to the original domain (8-12), it visits the Router
                    Agent again to inform it of the obtained results, allowing it to have new information to
                    update its knowledge base for future queries (13). That information is stored in the cases
                    base to be used in the learning process. Finally, the Collecting Agent goes back to its
                    domain, delivers the information and destroys itself (14-17).</p>
                    <center><h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2></center>
                    <p>A dynamic DSS that works efficiently, i.e., that does not constantly interrupt users
                        with information requirements they cannot satisfy, must be able to identify the relationship among the characteristics of consults and domains. By using data-mining techniques it was possible to define a discriminating function to classify the system domains
                        into two groups: those that can probably provide an answer to the information requirement made to the system, and those that can not do that. From this discriminating
                        function, the system knowledge base was designed, which stores the values of the
                        parameters required by such a function.<br>
                        On the other hand, the system needs to learn from the errors it could make during
                        its operation so that it can decrease the number of consulted domains in each information
                        requirement presented to the system. The use of data mining allowed the definition of
                        a data structure that is convenient for analyzing the system operation results and,
                        according to that, for designing a cases base to store the information associated to the
                        quality of each performed search.<br></p><br><br></div>
        </section>
        <section class="container5">
            <div class="data"><br><p>Moreover, the application of data mining to the cases base allowed the specification
                of rules to settle relationships among the stored cases with the aim of inferring possible
                causes of error in the domains classification. In this way, a learning mechanism was
                designed to update the knowledge base and thus improve the already made classification
                as regards the values assigned to the discriminating function.<br>
                The selection mechanism designed using data-mining techniques is feasible to be
                implemented by means of agents technology. For this purpose, the roles required to
                operate the system have been identified (Jennings, 2000), and each of them was assigned
                to be under the responsibility of different software agents. Mobile agents take consults
                to the domains identified by an intelligent agent called a router agent. This agent is
                responsible for the classification and learning mechanism designed in this work.
                In this way, it has been possible to design an agent-based architecture of a dynamic
                DSS that satisfies the main functionality specified for this system, i.e., to guide
                information requirements from users to the domains that offer the greatest possibility of
                answering them.<br></p>
